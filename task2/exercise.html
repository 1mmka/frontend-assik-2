        <h2>About Yuri Gagarin</h2>
        <p>
            Yuri Gagarin was a Soviet pilot and cosmonaut who became the first human to journey into outer space in 1961. 
            Born in 1934 in the village of Klushino, Russia, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Soviet Air Force. 
            His historic flight aboard Vostok 1 made him an international hero and a symbol of Soviet space achievement. 
            Gagarin's legacy continues to inspire generations of explorers and scientists. 
            He tragically died in a jet crash in 1968 at the age of 34.
